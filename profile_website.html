        Welcome to my profile page! <br>
        <br>
        You may have noticed scrambled text and weird behavior all around the website.<br>
        <br> 
        To unscramble the original contents or to make the boxes stay still, you must scare them straight! 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Yes... You must use their greatest weakness, 
        <b> Grass</b>. 
        I've grassified your cursor so if you bring it close to the misbehaving html and css elements, 
        they'll fall back in line and turn to normal! <br>
